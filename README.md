# AI-Image-Classification

This repository contains code and resources for an AI-based image classification project focused on detecting fake face images generated by various GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). The project utilizes deep learning techniques to distinguish between real and fake facial images using a curated dataset.

## Dataset

The core dataset used in this project is:  
[Fake Face Images Generated from Different GANs on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankjha146025/fake-face-images-generated-from-different-gans)

- **Description**: This dataset contains fake face images generated by different GAN models (such as StyleGAN, ProGAN, etc.) as well as real face images. The dataset is organized by GAN type and includes high-quality, diverse face samples.
- **Usage**: Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above and place it in the appropriate directory as specified in the project instructions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calvin-77/AI-Image-Classification.git
cd AI-Image-Classification
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

- Go to the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankjha146025/fake-face-images-generated-from-different-gans).
- Download the dataset and extract it into the `data/` directory in this repository.

### 4. Train the Model

Example command (adjust as needed):

```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir data --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
```

### 5. Evaluate the Model

Example command:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.pth --data_dir data/validation
```
